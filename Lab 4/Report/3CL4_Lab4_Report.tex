\section{Design of Phase-Lead Compensator}
The procedure that was applied to design a phase lead compensator with desired design requirements was the same procedure followed in the pre-lab exercises.

The phase lead compensator was designed in a MATLAB script, with the code relevant to the design of the compensator found in Listing~\ref{listing:design_p1}. The procedure is detailed in comments found in the MATLAB script. The parameters of the desired phase lead compensator were found to be $z = 8$, $p = 20.7149$, and $k_c = 1.8154$. The resulting phase lead compensator controller $G_c(s) = 1.8154 \frac{s + 8}{s + 20.7149}$.

The velocity error constant is found using the MATLAB code in Listing~\ref{listing:design_p2}. The velocity error constant was found to be 19.6943.

The transfer function for the closed-loop system was generated in Listing~\ref{listing:design_p3}. The transfer function $T_s = \frac{354.1s + 2833}{s^3 + 27.66s^2 + 498s + 2833}$. The poles of the transfer function were placed at $-9.6115 \pm 15.6025j$ and $-8.4364$, and the zero of the transfer function was placed at $-8$.

The step response is plotted using the MATLAB code shown in Listing~\ref{listing:design_p4}. The plot of the step response is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:step_response}.

The unit ramp response is plotted using the MATLAB code shown in Listing~\ref{listing:design_p5}. The plot of the unit ramp response is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:unit_ramp_response}.

We can see from the step response in Figure~\ref{fig:step_response} that we are close to our desired design requirements. The percent overshoot is slightly less than 20\% at around 17\%, and the settling time is around the 0.5 sec requirement. The steady-state error for the unit ramp response in Figure~\ref{fig:unit_ramp_response} is around $0.05$, which matches the calculated steady-state error value for the unit ramp response (1 / velocity error constant = 0.508). 

As our design was done using approximations for a second-order system with no zeros, it is expected that there will be some discrepancies in the results as the system in use for the servomotor is a third-order system with one zero. However, we can see that the approximations still allow us to design a system that is close to meeting the design requirements. Such a system could be a good initial design that could later be adjusted to get closer to the design requirements.

\section{Experiment with Phase Lead Compensator}
The amplitude of the disturbance was set to 0. The numerator coefficients of the controller were $k_c$ for s term and $k_cz$ for the constant term, and for the denominator they were 1 for the s term and $p$ for the constant term. We entered them into the controller block in descending order of power.

The measured peak overshoot and 2\% settling time were \_ and \_, respectively.

% exp2, reasons that contribute to the deviation (non-linearities, order of model)
A potential source of the discrepancies could be the inherent non-linear effects of the simulation model. Also, all of our calculations were based on approximations for a second-order system with no zeros, while the system we designed has an extra pole and zero, so this causes some discrepancies as well. While we did pick values for our dominant poles that put them in safer positions (further left on the plane) to account for the extra pole and zero, there is still some deviation.
